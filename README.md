You can add users by filling the **Add User** form and it will be updated.
Furthermore, you are able to modify users by just clicking the **Modify** button and updating their data:

## Software needed
To use this CRUD, you will need to install:

 - **XAMPP**: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html
 - **MySQL Workbench**: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
 
 **Note** that I'm using this both softwares to run the PHP server and host the database, but you cand use other alternatives as WAMP to host the local server and PHP MyAdmin to create the database, it will work fine if you set it up right.

## How to set it up
To config PHP connection to database, you will need to go to the **connect.php** file and change the connection variables to yours making them match with your database host, port, socket, user, password and dbname as shown:
